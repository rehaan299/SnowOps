### City of Edmonton — Prototype (Dummy Data)

> **Disclaimer**
> This repository is a **proof-of-concept prototype** built using **simulated (dummy) data**.
> No real operational, financial, or GIS data from the City of Edmonton is used.
> The project demonstrates *methodology, structure, and analytical thinking*, not production forecasts.

##  Project Overview

Winter operations are one of the most complex and resource-intensive responsibilities for northern municipalities.
Snow and ice control must balance:

* Public safety
* Accessibility
* Budget constraints
* Operational capacity
* Service level commitments

This project demonstrates how **historical performance data**, combined with **simple forecasting techniques** and **spatially enabled datasets**, can be used to **anticipate next-season snow removal demand** and support **data-driven operational planning**.

The prototype focuses on forecasting:

* Expected number of **snow events**
* Anticipated **road clearing operations**
* Distribution of workload across **road priority classes**
* Spatial implications of the forecast at the **route level**

---

##  Objectives

This prototype was designed to achieve the following objectives:

### 1. Historical Performance Analysis

Analyze historical winter operations data to understand:

* Variability in snow events year-to-year
* Relationship between snow events and operational workload
* Differences in servicing patterns across road priorities

### 2. Forecasting Future Demand

Produce a reasonable, explainable forecast for:

* Number of snow events in the upcoming winter
* Expected clearing operations by road priority (P1–P4)

### 3. Spatial Awareness

Demonstrate how forecasted operational demand can be:

* Joined to spatial road network data
* Visualized geographically
* Used to understand *where* operational pressure will occur

### 4. Performance & Resource Planning

Illustrate how forecasts can inform:

* Staffing and equipment planning
* Budget preparation
* Service-level risk identification
* Proactive decision-making

### 5. Transparency & Reproducibility

Provide:

* Clear documentation
* A clean project structure
* Outputs that can be regenerated by running the pipeline

---

##  Operational Context 

Snow and ice removal is not driven solely by total snowfall.

**Key insight:**

> The *number of snow events* is often more impactful than total snowfall.

For example:

* Ten small snowfalls require ten mobilizations
* One large snowfall may be handled in a single extended operation

This makes forecasting **event frequency** particularly valuable for:

* Budget smoothing
* Resource readiness
* Avoiding under- or over-preparation

Municipal performance frameworks increasingly emphasize:

* Predictability
* Outcome-based targets
* Evidence-driven planning

This project aligns directly with those principles.

##  Data Description 

### Historical Winter Data

A synthetic dataset was created to represent multiple winter seasons of operations data.

Each season includes:

* Winter year
* Number of snow events
* Total snowfall
* Number of clearing operations by road priority:

  * Priority 1 (major roads)
  * Priority 2 (arterials / collectors)
  * Priority 3 (industrial / rural)
  * Priority 4 (residential)

The dummy data intentionally includes:

* Mild winters
* Average winters
* Severe winters

This variability reflects real-world uncertainty and operational volatility.

---

### Spatial Road Network Data

A simulated spatial dataset represents road segments with:

* Geometry (LineString)
* Route identifiers
* Priority classification (P1–P4)

This allows forecast results to be:

* Assigned to individual routes
* Visualized geographically
* Extended into GIS-based planning tools

---

## High Level Methodology 

The project follows a standard analytics workflow:

### 1. Exploratory Analysis

* Examine year-to-year variability
* Identify outliers and extreme seasons
* Understand relationships between events and operations

### 2. Forecasting Approach

* Use historical averages as a **baseline forecast**
* Favor explainability over complexity
* Avoid overfitting due to small sample size

This approach is intentionally conservative and transparent, making it suitable for:

* Budget planning
* Executive communication
* Early-stage decision support

### 3. Operational Assumptions

* Priority 1–3 roads are serviced during every snow event
* Residential roads (Priority 4) are serviced less frequently
* Residential clearing frequency is estimated using historical ratios

### 4. Spatial Integration

* Forecast results are joined to route-level spatial data
* Each road segment is assigned an expected number of clearings
* Output can be used in GIS tools or dashboards

---

##  Outputs Produced

The project generates:

### Forecast Summary

* Predicted number of snow events for the upcoming winter
* Expected clearing operations by priority class

### Visual Outputs

* Historical snow events vs forecast
* Comparison of last season vs forecasted operations by priority

### Spatial Output

* GeoJSON with forecasted operations attached to each road segment

These outputs allow stakeholders to:

* Quickly understand workload expectations
* Identify operational risk
* Communicate anticipated service levels

---

##  Technology Stack

The prototype uses a modern, analytics-focused stack:

* **Python** – Core analysis and forecasting
* **Pandas / NumPy** – Data manipulation and calculations
* **GeoPandas** – Spatial data integration
* **Matplotlib** – Visualization
* **GIS-ready formats (GeoJSON)** – Interoperability

The stack is intentionally lightweight, portable, and reproducible.





##  Results & Interpretation

The prototype forecast indicates:

* A return to a **typical winter workload**
* Increased operational demand compared to an unusually mild year
* More frequent residential clearing cycles

* Mild winters can distort budgeting if used alone
* Forecasting helps avoid under-resourcing
* Anticipating residential blading frequency improves public communication and planning

---

##  Limitations

This prototype intentionally has limitations:

* Uses dummy data
* Does not include real meteorological forecasts
* Forecasts seasonal totals, not event timing
* Assumes historical patterns remain relevant

These limitations are appropriate for a **proof-of-concept** and are explicitly documented.

---



Potential extensions include:

* Integration with seasonal climate forecasts (e.g., ENSO indicators)
* Advanced time-series models (ARIMA, Prophet)
* Route-level or district-level forecasting
* Real-time winter dashboard integration
* Forecast vs actual performance benchmarking
* Integration with route optimization tools

---



This project demonstrates:

* Analytical thinking beyond basic dashboards
* Understanding of municipal operations
* Ability to connect data → forecasting → planning → performance
* Clean documentation and reproducibility
* Readiness for real-world data integration

It shows how **predictive analytics** can move winter operations from **reactive** to **prepared**.

---


While simplified, this prototype reflects how municipalities can:

* Use historical performance intelligently
* Anticipate operational demand
* Improve transparency and decision-making
* Align analytics with service delivery goals

It serves as a strong foundation for real-world implementation and further technical expansion.
